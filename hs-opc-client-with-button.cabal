-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
synopsis:            Haskell client for OpenPixelControl with push-button input

-- A longer description of the package.
description:         Controls a string of lights via the
                     OpenPixelControl protocol.  You can switch
                     between different light patterns by pressing a
                     button.  The button should be connected between
                     GND and GPIO2 on your Raspberry Pi.  Uses the
                     wiringPi library to talk to the GPIO, so you must
                     install the wiringPi C library ("sudo apt-get
                     install wiringpi") before you build this program.
